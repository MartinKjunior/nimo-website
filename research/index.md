Our research focusses on development and application neuroimaging and modelling approaches to study brain physiology. The group is composed of multiple PIs with research spanning measurements of cerebrovascular (dys)function, brain microstructure, brain circuits and connectivity and glymphatic function. The group predominantly uses magnetic resonance imaging, however other approaches such as EEG, multiphoton microscopy, and functional ultrasound are developed and used.
