With a background in both physics (MPhys Oxford, 1997) and neuroscience (MSc, UCL 1999), Laura's research is focussed on developing novel methodology to study brain function. Following a PhD on quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (UCL, 2002), she moved to the Netherlands to complete postdoctoral research using fMRI and MEG. In 2005, she returned to the UK, first to the University of Liverpool and, since 2008, the University of Manchester. One principle area of reseach concerns mechanisms of brain plasticity following a New Investigators Award from the Medical Research Council in 2006. I continue to study the cerebrovascular system, and have developed quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow, microvessel structure, oxygen metabolism and blood-brain barrier integrity. Key applications are in ageing, cerebral small vessel disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's Disease with an aim to understand mechanisms of cognitive decline.
